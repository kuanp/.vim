# .vim

This folder contains all necessary pieces to make vim work like I would personally want it.

SET UP:

1. git clone this folder to ~/

2. run ./install.sh

3. (set your terminal to solaris colors, usually on your mac side)
  On your mac, also do 1&2, and go up  one directory using explorer to open the change-solarized-color folder. Double click on one of the term color options.
