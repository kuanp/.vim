# .vim

This folder contains all necessary pieces to make vim work like I would personally want it.

SET UP:

1. git clone this folder to ~/

2. run ./install.sh

3. (set your terminal to solaris colors, usually on your mac side)
  On your mac, git clone the repo, unzip change-solarized-color.tar.gz using explorer, and double click on the extract folder, then open the light.term
