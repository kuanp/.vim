# .vim

This folder contains all necessary pieces to make vim work like I would personally want it.

SET UP:

1. git clone this folder to ~/

2. run ./install.sh

3. (set your terminal to solaris colors, usually on your mac side)
  unzip&open color-solarized folder and select whichever option you prefer.
